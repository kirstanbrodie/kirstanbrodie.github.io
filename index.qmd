I am a PhD candidate in Social Psychology at Cornell University working with [Dr. Amy Krosch](https://www.kroschlab.com/) and [Dr. Tom Gilovich](https://www.thomasgilovich.com/).

**I study the cognitive processes and motivations underlying stereotype persistence.**

My current research focuses on the reward value of stereotype confirmation, i.e. the idea that people find it subjectively rewarding when their stereotype-based expectations about a person are confirmed. I am interested in how this reward value may reinforce people's stereotype beliefs over time. I am also currently investigating neural responses to stereotype violations and other forms of expectation violation, aiming to identify mechanisms that hinder belief updating.

I use a multi-method approach to explore these questions, including behavioral experiments, computational modeling, and functional neuroimaging.
