    "text": "I am a PhD student in Social Psychology at Cornell University, working primarily with Dr. Amy Krosch.\nI study the cognitive processes and motivations underlying prejudice and stereotyping.\nMy current research focuses on the reward value of stereotype confirmation, i.e. the idea that people find it subjectively rewarding when their stereotype-based expectations about a person are confirmed. I am interested in how this reward value may reinforce people’s stereotype beliefs over time.\nI use a multi-method approach to explore these questions, including behavioral experiments, computational modeling, and functional neuroimaging."
