I am a PhD student in Social Psychology at Cornell University, working primarily with [Dr. Amy Krosch](https://www.kroschlab.com/).

**I study the cognitive processes and motivations underlying prejudice and stereotyping.**

My current research focuses on the reward value of stereotype confirmation, i.e. the idea that people find it subjectively rewarding when their stereotype-based expectations about a person are confirmed. I am interested in how this reward value may reinforce people's stereotype beliefs over time.

I use a multi-method approach to explore these questions, including behavioral experiments, computational modeling, and functional neuroimaging.
